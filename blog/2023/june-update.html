         <h1>June update.</h1>
     
         <time datetime="4-6-2023">4th of June, 2023</time>
 
         <p>Huh, it's been a long time since I last wrote a post or even worked on this website at all. To be fair, a lot of stuff has happened
             to me irl: I had to attend to legal stuff (specially paperwork), my birthday was on may 4th, I'm trying to get my driving
             license, I recently did an official Cambridge english exam to get the B1 certificate, I recently got a job offer and some personal 
             stuff I won't tell for my privacy's sake.
         </p>
 
         <p>I also repaired an old pc I intend to use one day as my own server, but until then it will be my desk pc, I only have to buy a wifi usb
             for it to connect to the internet.</p>
 
         <p>I kinda missed to write blog posts, ngl.<br> But now, what will be the future of this blog?</p>
 
         <p>
             I know probably no one will care but as I basically said on my <a href="https://www.juangames.com/blog/2023/2023-yeah-about-that.html">
             previous entry</a> I will only write blog posts when I feel like doing so, at the end of the day this is just my personal blog, 
             a side project of mine.
         </p>
 
         <p>On the other hand, by the time I'm finishing this I've updated the menu buttons and created a button for newgrounds on the sidebar,
             now I just gotta make a few more for DA and twitter.
         </p>
 
         <p>It's been like <b>two f*cking weeks</b> since I started this post and haven't even started the buttons, I couldn't work due to rain and the 
             Cambridge exam's results will be available by mid July, lmao.
         </p>
 
         <p>Taking that aside, I gotta update the About section so it contains links to other pages such as my commission rules, legal stuff
             if needed, contact, etc. The problem is that I have no idea how to make a dropdown menu for the moment, so I think it will be a list
             of links to the mentioned pages, just like <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/wiki" type="_blank">NG wiki</a> once again.
         </p>
 
         <p>Anyway, I think that's all for this post, see you in the next one! (^_^)/</p>
