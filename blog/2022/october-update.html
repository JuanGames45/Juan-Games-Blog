        <p>You see, I'm not telling the exact reasons why bc it is way too personal, but in short I've
            moved on and I can't get my pc back, nor the data stored in it.
        </p>

        <p>I could use the laptop but my room is a serious mess right now. I have to order my stuff 
            to draw with the laptop.
        </p>

        <p>Infact, I'm not writing this with the laptop, but with an old pc I found. which can barely handle
            the web browser, hell, it even has a floppy drive!
            <br>
            For writting is cool, but with other stuff...
        </p>

        <p>At first I wanted to upgrade it, but because everything in it is basically obsolete, I would
            have to replace every component, and it simply doesn't worth it.
            <br>
            So I'll have to make a new pc from scratch, getting the pieces over time.
        </p>

        <p>So for now I think I'll focus more on writing rather than drawing.
            <br>
            And fun fact, I saved it on a floppy disk lmao.
        </p>

            Welp, that's all for today!
