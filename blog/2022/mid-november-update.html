        <p>Hey there! I'm back with another monthly update, now with an actual excuse about why I forgot to
            write this earlier XD.
        </p>

        <p>The reason of why I haven't drawn much, is becaus I've been focusing with my personal projects, such
            as my education (yes, IK it sounds clich√© but it's true lol).
        </p>

        <p>So yeah, I don't have as much time to draw nor work on this blog as I had before.<br>
            But if you wanna know how I'm doing rn, I'm fine. Infact, I'm better than I've eber been, and I really know
            what I want to do with my life from now on.
        </p>

        <p>Previously, the only thing I knew is that I wanted to work out of art (and I still want), but seeing how hard
            it is for an artist to even get a job...<br>
            I'm going to keep art purely as a hobby (atleast fir now) and learn coding to get a stable job.
        </p>

        <p>In the meantime, I'll be improving at art and basically do what actually makes me happy, thanks to this I discovered I love photography
            and recently I started to learn how to play the drums.
        </p>
        
        <p>And regarding this blog... The main goal is to be a little space for write long posts like people did way back in the early 2000's.
            So I decided to keep it like that, a little space for me to write long posts like people did in the mid 2000's. <br>
            I'm also going to change the comment system so you can comment without previously creating an account (mail is always required, sorry).
        </p>

        <p>I also had an idea. Once I get enought practice, and get to buy an electric drumset, I could do some covers with the drums and
            upload them to youtube!
        </p>

        <p>Of course, I won't show my face. I don't want to show it on the internet for my privacy's sake. Also, this is just an idea that
            I thought it would be cool to do.
        </p>

        <p>Welp, that's it for now. This is Juan Games and I'll see you in the next post. ^^</p>
