        <p>What's up everybody on the internet?</p>

        <p>As I mentioned in my last <a href="https://www.juangames.com/blog/2022/april-update.html">post</a>, I said I was going to get a heart
            surgery, you guys remember?
            <br>
            Well, I recieved the call from the hospital telling me when I'm going to get operated. It will be this april 19 in the morning.
        </p>

        <p>For whoever that doesn't know, I have a heart deformation, which was corrected. But now the thing must be changed before
            it expires (yes, they do that).
        </p>

        <p>To be honest, I don't know how to say it, I've always considered myself bad at expressing myself in a personal level,
            having to check the text thirty times, just to see if I did it in the right way.
            <br>
            So for now I'm going to say "fuck it" and write as it comes out my mind.
        </p>

        <p>Am I going to die? Nope (although possible, there's less than 1% of chances, but it's still there).
            <br>
            This is just to announce it more than antything, telling that I won't be able to draw (now for impossiblity rather than lazyness lol).
            <br>
            Still, I will still be active as usual in my other social media you have in the sidebar such as 
            <a href="https://juangames45.newgrounds.com">newgrounds</a>, 
            <a href="https://twitter.com/juangames45">twitter</a>, etc. ( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°)
        </p>

        <p>Of course, I will tell everyone when I'll get the surgery, until then, I leave for now. Cya ＼(￣O￣)</p>
