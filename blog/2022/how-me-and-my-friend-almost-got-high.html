            <p>As the title says, one time me and a friend almost got high when we were going back from school.
                <br>
                Everything has a logical explination and nowdays is just a story of the many others I have to tell.
                Of course we didn't get high for real, and I seriously <b>DO NOT</b> encourage anyone to do drugs.
                <br>
                With that said, let's start shall we?
            </p>
    
            <p>All of this happened when we were little, I was on 6th grade and my father finally gave me permission to
                go home by myself. I was coming back from school with my friend (who I'm going to call Luc for privacy and
                convinience's sake), that also happened to be my neightbor, so we walked in the same direction.
            </p>
    
            <p>Once we only had to turn around the corner to arrive home, we found some sort of "pills" on the floor.
                <br>
                But not those you're probably thinking of, they were soft and broke apart easily, revealing a pink dust (and there was
                a bit on the floor already).
            </p>
    
            <p>Then, he smelled the pink dust (without sniffing it), in his words it smelled like coke, and asked me if I wanted to smell too.</p>
    
            <p>I declined the offer, we threw whatever that was and we went back to our places.</p>
    
            <p>That afternoon I asked my dad if Luc could come home to play, but he said Luc had a headache and he couldn't come to play.
                <br>
                So I didn't think much about it. 
            </p>
    
            <p id="img_comment">Now that I'm transcribing the post into html, and I currenly know how much of a liar and a manipulator my father is, that probably was a lie so he wouldn't come home to play.</p>
    
            <p>Hours later, I was watching TV with my father that talked about that two new drugs were invented, one of them being pink cocaine.</p>
    
            <p>Because of that I shuted up for a few years until I confesed it to my mom.
                <br>
                Unfortunally, I can't remember that moment.
            </p>
    
            <p>And that was my story, I hope you liked it, and I'll see you in the next one.</p>
