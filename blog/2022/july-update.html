        <p>Hey!... I'm back with another post...</p>

        <p>Yeah, I wanna apologize for not writing an update for the month of june. Luckily, it hasn't
            happened much on june except that my commissions are open at the time I'm writing this.
            <br>
            You can see the info <a href="https://www.juangames.com/about/file.html">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>Besides that, let's start with the real thing, shall we?</p>

        <p>First of all, I wanna try doing a little experiment.
            <br>
            You see, the other day I saw 
            <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/team-fortress-2-fans-push-valve-into-releasing-another-beefy-update/">this article</a>
            on PCgamer and I had an idea, recording my voice so you have the option to lisen to the post
            instead of reading
        </p>

        <p>Just in the case you are in the street or in the car and you want to lisen to whatever post I made or
            you're simply too lazy to read the whole thing (not judging for it).
        </p>

        <p>In any case, it will be my actual voice instead of a robotic one like the mentioned article and
            I will make two versions: English and Spanish (my naive language).
            <br>
            The English one will be embeded here and both of them will be uploaded onto my youtube channel.
        </p>

        <p id="img_comment">Side note: idk how I thought the article's voice was made by a robot. It 
            probably was the tone lmao.
        </p>

        <p>Here's a poll to see if you like the idea:</p>

        <p id="img_comment">Side note 2: Here should be a poll, but it was a plugin of wordpress on the previous blog
            <br>
            (Spoiler, no one voted lmao)
        </p>
        
        <p>And this brings us to the next point, polls.
            <br>
            From now on you can expect encountering with polls such as the one you have on the sidebar,
            in this case, about what avatar should be the face of the site.
        </p>

        <p>To finish this post, I wanna say I'll take August free for vacation, I may make new drawings or not.
            But at the end of the day, drawing is a hobby for me, which I want it to be my full-time job in a future.
            <br>
            If you order a commission on this month, I will work on it even if it's August, but I won't accept new
            commission orders during that month.
        </p>

       <p>Aaaaand that's pretty much it, hope you liked it and see you in the next post.
        <br>
        Byeeee. ＼(￣O￣)
