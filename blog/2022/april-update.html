         <h1 id="ptitle">April Update</h1>

         <time datetime="2-3-2022">2nd of April, 2022</time>
         
 
         <p>Another month, another update.</p>
 
         <p>This time I have very important news (not an april fools joke).
             From here to a couple of months I will have a heart operation, I will tell you when I get
             hospitalized so you know I won't be drawing or working on the website.
         </p>
 
         <p>I won't get into a lot of details, because at the end of the day, it's my privated life.
             <br>
             But in short, I have a heart deformation which has to be fixed again with a newer device than
             the one I currently have, which is expiring (yes, they do that).
         </p>
 
         <p>But don't worry about me, unlike in the US, here in Spain we have a free public healthcare system
             and there's only a 1% chances of dying.
         </p>
 
         <p>Getting into other stuff, I added a forum, and likewise, an account system.
             <br>
             Because of that you need to create an account to comment (you can create one <a>here</a>)
         </p>
         <p id="img_comment">(PS: The link used to work back when this was in wordpress)</p>
 
         <p>Now, this holds a problem, I'm legally required to write the terms of use and a privacy policy,
             all because it's mandatory for any website that gathers personal info (every account gathers
             at the minimum the email).
             <br>
             So I'll be focusing on that.
         </p>
 
         <p>And that's all for the moment, hope you liked, and I'll see you in the next post!</p>
