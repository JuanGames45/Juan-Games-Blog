        <p>Another month, another update.</p>

        <p>This time I have very important news (not an april fools joke).
            From here to a couple of months I will have a heart operation, I will tell you when I get
            hospitalized so you know I won't be drawing or working on the website.
        </p>

        <p>I won't get into a lot of details, because at the end of the day, it's my privated life.
            <br>
            But in short, I have a heart deformation which has to be fixed again with a newer device than
            the one I currently have, which is expiring (yes, they do that).
        </p>

        <p>But don't worry about me, unlike in the US, here in Spain we have a free public healthcare system
            and there's only a 1% chances of dying.
        </p>

        <p>Getting into other stuff, I added a forum, and likewise, an account system.
            <br>
            Because of that you need to create an account to comment (you can create one <a>here</a>)
        </p>
        <p id="img_comment">(PS: The link used to work back when this was in wordpress)</p>

        <p>Now, this holds a problem, I'm legally required to write the terms of use and a privacy policy,
            all because it's mandatory for any website that gathers personal info (every account gathers
            at the minimum the email).
            <br>
            So I'll be focusing on that.
        </p>

        <p>And that's all for the moment, hope you liked, and I'll see you in the next post!</p>
