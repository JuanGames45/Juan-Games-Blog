        <p>What's up everybody on the internet?</p>

        <p>Basically everything went perfectly, the surgery was a success and I'm recovering at home.
            <br>
            The best part is that I can be drawing all day long so I get enough practice for commissions
            (which will be probably open in june-july).
        </p>

        <p>But I haven't been fixing the website, why? Because lazyness :v
            <br>
            There's no excuse, I've been drawing all day long and I forgot completely abut the website,
            the proof being that I'm writing this on the 18th instead of 1st.
