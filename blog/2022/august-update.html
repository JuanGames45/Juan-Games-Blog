        <p>Hey there! Welcome to the August update!
            <br>
            This time I started writing the post beforehand haha.
        </p>

        <p>But for real tho, this time I actually have some news to share. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</p>

        <p>First of all, I decided to delete the forum, I realized than is useless for an amateur artist's
            website.
            <br>
            Plus, I got a bot spammer registered on the site, so I'll need to update the registration method
            for a double opt-in. Which means than when you sign-in you'll recieve an email to confirm your regustration.
        </p>

        <p>Next thing is about the discord server, I decided to delete it and create a new one for two main reasons:
            <br>
            Absolute Lack of activity, and the main one, it was hard to moderate bc of the NSFW part along with changing
            anything anything about the roles, at the point where it was easier to start from scratch.
        </p>

        <p>This time is a fully SFW server, maybe in the future I'll make another server NSFW.
            <br>
            As you can understand, I want to keep them apart as far as possible from each other.
        </p>

        <p>Third thing is... I don't know if it's the right time to announce it, but I plan to make a webcomic.
            <br>
            And idk if it's the right time because I don't even know where the story is going to end, I just know
            where is it going for now and the backstory of the main characters.
        </p>

        <p>It will be a gigantic task to make it. I know I could do like mangakas that makes chapter by chapter weekly
            (story, drawing etc). But let's be real, I'm too inexperienced and lazy to do that; plus, I want to make a
            coherent story with as less script holes as possible.
            <br>
            So I want to makes sure the script is polished enough before translating it into comic format.
        </p>

        <p>I think this is my most ambicious project to date, even more than this website.
            <br>
            Speaking of which, I seriously need to finish the damm privacy policy. Also, I decided not to go ahead with the plan
            of making audios of these posts.
            <br>
            I'm not afraid to show my voice, but I think my english pronunciation is a bit poor to read long texts perfectly,
            and no one was going to use it anyway (I seriously doubt than one or two people even read this posts).
        </p>

        <p>Remember than I posted a poll to decide what avatar should be the face of the site?
            <br>
            After thinking about it for a long time, I've decided than the face should be my human avatar. I will design it to
            make it look even more like my irl self; specially the hairstyle, which I know now how to draw it and I changed
            it a bit lmao.
        </p>

        <p>And finally, I'm going to take august completely free for vacation, I may draw or not, but I won't accept any new
            commissions nor I'll be working on this website (mainly because in my family's shared house there's no router lmao)
            but I'll still be active on social media.
        </p>

        <p>This is Juan Games, and I'll see you in the next post. Cya. ＼(￣O￣)</p>
