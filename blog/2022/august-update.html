        <p>Hey there! Welcome to the August update!
            <br>
            This time I started writing the post beforehand haha.
        </p>

        <p>But for real tho, this time I actually have some news to share. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</p>

        <p>First of all, I decided to delete the forum, I realized than is useless for an amateur artist's
            website.
            <br>
            Plus, I got a bot spammer registered on the site, so I'll need to update the registration method
            for a double opt-in. Which means than when you sign-in you'll recieve an email to confirm your regustration.
        </p>

        <p>Next thing is about the discord server, I decided to delete it and create a new one for two main reasons:
            <br>
            Absolute Lack of activity, and the main one, it was hard to moderate bc of the NSFW part along with changing
            anything anything about the roles, at the point where it was easier to start from scratch.
