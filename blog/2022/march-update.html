        <p>What's up everybody on the internet</p>

        <p>Is March, we are exiting from winter and entering in that bridge until summer called spring. In my case, cold season
            and crazy weather (seriously, during the whole winter I was able to go out with a simple tracksuit and
            now I need a jacket because it's too cold lol).
        </p>

        <p>Stupidity aside, let's see what plans I have for the future, shall we?</p>

        <p>To begin with, my purpose for this month is finishing the website. As you can see there's still a lot of visual
            errors, if you come from the future they are probably fixed, so here's a screenshot so you see what I mean:
        </p>

        <p>Secondly, I have the intention of getting better at drawing, since the quality of the drawing is pretty inconsistent
            (also awful lmao), and I'm not specially good with human anatomy.
        </p>

        <p>I also have a much bigger project, which is in a very early developement state.
            <br>
            Because of that, I won't give a lot of details for the moment, I've been thinking about it for a few months, but I
            want to create a good story beforehand.
        </p>

        <p>This is the last entry I'm posting in social media like <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/juangames45" target="_blank">DA</a> and 
            <a href="https://juangames45.newgrounds.com/" target="_blank">NG</a>. I feel like the blog is in a decent state. 
            <br>
            So from now on I will only announce when I post a new entry.
