            <p>Go ahead and leave me.
                I think I prefer to stay inside.
                Maybe you'll find someone else
                To help you.
                Maybe Black Mesa...
                THAT WAS A JOKE, HA HA, FAT CHANCE.
                
                Anyway this cake is great
                It's so delicious and moist
                
                Look at me still talking when there's science to do
                When I look out there
                It makes me GLaD I'm not you.
                
                I've experiments to run
                There is research to be done
                On the people who are
                Still alive.
                
                And believe me I am still alive
                I'm doing science and I'm still alive
                I feel FANTASTIC and I'm still alive
                While you're dying I'll be still alive
                And when you're dead I will be still alive
                Still alive
                Still alive. </p>

            <p>It's hard to overstate my satisfaction. Aperture Science.
                We do what we must
                Because we can.
                For the good of all of us.
                Except the ones who are dead.
                
                But there's no sense crying
                Over every mistake.
                You just keep on trying
                Till you run out of cake.
                And the Science gets done.
                And you make a neat gun.
                For the people who are
                Still alive.
                
                I'm not even angry.
                I'm being so sincere right now.
                Even though you broke my heart.
                And killed me.
                
                And tore me to pieces.
                And threw every piece into a fire.
                As they burned it hurt because
                I was so happy for you!
                
                Now these points of data
                Make a beautiful line.
                And we're out of beta.
                We're releasing on time.
                So I'm GLaD. I got burned.
                Think of all the things we learned
                For the people who are
                Still alive.
