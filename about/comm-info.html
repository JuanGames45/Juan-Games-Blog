	<p>Before you commission me, please, make sure you have read this terms and conditions beforehand. I
	will answer any question if you have any doubt you may have. Also, keep in mind this page is merely 
	a reference one and for example, prices, may vary depending on the commission's complexity.</p>

	<p>If you want to jump to a specific section, here is the table of contents:</p>

	<h2 id="types">Commission types</h2>

	<p>I offer three types of commissions:<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Lineart and flat colors: 10€</li>
		<li>Cell shading: 15€</li>
		<li>Soft shading: 19€</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>All prices listed above are in <b>European Euros (EUR)</b>. Since all payments are done trough 
	<b>paypal</b> any other currency is automatically converted on the payment.</p>

	<p>An extra character is a 50% increment of the base prize. And as for backgrounds, they are free of
	charge as long as they are simple.</p>

	<h2 id="how2order">How to order</h2>

	<p>To contact me, you can DM through social media such as: 
	<a href="https://www.bsky.app/profile/juangames@bsky.social">Bluesky</a>, 
	<a href="https://www.twitter.com/juangames45">Twitter</a> or 
	<a href="https://www.spacehey.com/juangames">SpaceHey</a>. You can also send me a message on a
	messaging app like Discord (@juangames) but you can check my 
	<a href="https://www.juangames.com/about/contact">contact page</a> for other ways of contact.</p>

	<p>As for the petition itself, you <b>must send references</b> for the character. As for the pose,
	you should also give a description.</p>

	<p>Once you've sent the message that you want a commission, I will answer ASAP. Usually I'll answer
	the same day, but I may delay some time if I'm busy.</p>

	<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>

	<p>Once I accept to do the commission, you <b>must pay upfront</b>. I will send you an invoice on 
	paypal and once I recieve the payment, I will start working on your commission and notify you
	about this.</p>

	<p>Over time, I'll send multiple WIPs for you to check the progress and make any changes in time so
	it's right for you. Keep in mind that the time to finish may vary depending on personal circumstances,
	health, the drawing's complexity, etc. I can't promise a time to finish but I'll try to finish in less
	than a week.</p>

	<h2 id="extranotes">Aditional Notes</h2>
	<p><b>I have the right to accept or decline any commission</b>.In the hipotetical scenario of having
	multiple commissions at once, I have the right to work in whichever commission I want to work at the
	moment. This isn't a "first come, first serve" service <em>(tho I'll try to do that)</em>.</p>

	<p>While the commission is still in a wip state, you have te right to request any changes you want.
	But once the lineart has begun, you may only request small changes (just please, try not to abuse it)
	since It's harder to change stuff once I'm on the lineart phase.</p>

	<p>As for the refunds, you will get a <b>100% refund</b> as long as one of this conditions apply, and
	the drawing it's still in a sketch phase.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>I am fisically unavailable to work on it (health condition, personal situation, etc)</li>
		<li>You regret the pursache</li>
		<li>I'm taking way too long</li>
	</ul>
	<p>As for a refund in the lineart phase. It's possible, but unless I'm unable to fisically work on it,
	it will be a <b>50%</b> refund since I've already invested too much effort. The refunds are always
	negotiable.</p>

	<p>You may use the finished drawing for personal use (Upload it on social media, use it as banner/pfp
	on social media, use it for your personal website etc) as long as you credit me. For comercial use
	please ask me beforehand.</p>

	<p><b>You may not claim the artwork as yours or use it for commercial purpose without my 
	consent</b>.</p>

	<p>I reserve the right to share the right to share the drawing on my social media unless agreed upon.
	<br>
	If you want to remain anonymous in my post, or you don't want me to share the image, it's perfectly
	fine. Just make sure to tell me beforehand before I publish it.</p>
