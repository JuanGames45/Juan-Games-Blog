    <![CDATA[<p>If I'm being honest, I never really liked the blogging features such as
            Deviantart's or tumblr, the customization options were either too limiting,
            behind a paywall or non-existing. And since I got into the world of 
             stuff, I don't really trust any
            program that is not open source.
         </p>

         <p>Because of this, and as a fan of retro stuff (specially 90's and mid 2000's),
            I decided to make my website from the ground up, this one being the second
            iteration of it to be accessible from mobile (seriosly, it was horrible
            to use it on a phone)</p>

         <p>And again, the :source code
            is available on this <a href="https://github.com/JuanGames45/Juan-Games-Blog" target="_blank">
            GitHub repository</a> for everyone to see. But this time, I'm also using
            another open source project called :Nutshell     
         </p>

         <p>Nutshell is a creative commons project made by Nicky case. The project
            consists of expandable explanations, every time you see a word starting with 
            a : symbol, it contains one. And if you click on it, you will get one. 
            Infact, there are some on this same page so you can see for yourself.
         </p>

         <p>In short, my goal with this project is to have a little space on the world
            wide web. Where I can share whatever I want in the form of nine yards of
            text called "blog post" like people did in the 2000's. And what better way
            of doing it than in a fully customizable, old-school website?
