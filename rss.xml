            <p>I'm gonna be honest, I have no idea on how to start this blog post, the proof being that I took a whole
                     damm week to even start writing this. Hell, I'm finishing this on a February 16th.</p>
        
                    <p>I feel like I have this blog a little abandoned, and kinda lost some motivation to keep improving it.
                    Months ago, I promised I would do a couple of things like redrawing the banner, changing the
                    comment system etc.
                    </p>
        
                    <p>But I ended up forgetting about it and procrastinated with this post...</p>
