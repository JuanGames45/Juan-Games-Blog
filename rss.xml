    <![CDATA[<p>If I'm being honest, I never really liked the blogging features such as
            Deviantart's or tumblr, the customization options were either too limiting,
            behind a paywall or non-existing. And since I got into the world of 
            <a href="#opensource">:open source</a> stuff, I don't really trust any
            program that is not open source.
         </p>

         <p>Because of this, and as a fan of retro stuff (specially 90's and mid 2000's),
            I decided to make my website from the ground up, this one being the second
            iteration of it to be accessible from mobile (seriosly, it was horrible
            to use it on a phone)</p>

         <p>And again, the <a href="#sourcecode">:source code</a>
            is available on this <a href="https://github.com/JuanGames45/Juan-Games-Blog" target="_blank">
            GitHub repository</a> for everyone to see. But this time, I'm also using
            another open source project called <a href="https://ncase.me/nutshell/#WhatIsNutshell">:Nutshell</a>        
         </p>

         <p>Nutshell is a creative commons project made by Nicky case. The project
            consists of expandable explanations, every time you see a word starting with 
            a : symbol, it contains one. And if you click on it, you will get one. 
            Infact, there are some on this same page so you can see for yourself.
         </p>

         <p>In short, my goal with this project is to have a little space on the world
            wide web. Where I can share whatever I want in the form of nine yards of
            text called "blog post" like people did in the 2000's. And what better way
            of doing it than in a fully customizable, old-school website?
         </p>



         <!--Nutshell explanations-->

         <h2>:x opensource</h2>
         <p>Open source is any piece of <a href="#sourcecode">:source code</a> that is available for
            everyone to see, and usually, free (as of liberty) for everyone to modify,
            redistribute and even sell. But this depends on the license the creator of
            the program decides to use.
         </p>
         <h2>:x sourcecode</h2>
         <p>Basically, the code a programmer writes since the computer can only 
            understand binary.
