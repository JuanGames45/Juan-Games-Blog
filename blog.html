         <p>To be honeest, I don't even know where to start with this.
          <br>
          As y'all may know sleep is <b>essential</b> to be a functionally capable human being,
          without it, we wouldn't have the rest we need to regenerate our sanity.

              to me irl: I had to attend to legal stuff (specially paperwork), my birthday was on may 4th...</p>

            <p>I'm gonna be honest, I have no idea on how to start this blog post, the proof being that I took a whole
             damm week to even start writing this. Hell, I'm finishing this on a February 15th.</p>

            <p>I feel like I have this blog a little abandoned, and kinda lost some motivation to keep improving it.
            Months ago, I promised I would do a couple of things like redrawing the banner, changing the
            comment system etc.
            </p>

            <p>But I ended up forgetting about it and procrastinated with this post...</p>

          <p>Hey there! I'm back with another monthly update, now with an actual excuse about why I forgot to
          write this earlier XD.
          </p>

          <p>The reason of why I haven't drawn much, is becaus I've been focusing with my personal projects, such
          as my education (yes, IK it sounds cliché but it's true lol).
          </p>

          <p>So yeah, I don't have as much time to draw nor work on this blog as I had before.<br>
          But if you wanna know how I'm doing rn, I'm fine. Infact, I'm better than I've eber been, and I really know
          what I want to do with my life from now on...

        <p>You see, I'm not telling the exact reasons why bc it is way too personal, but in short I've
            moved on and I can't get my pc back, nor the data stored in it.
        </p>

        <p>I could use the laptop but my room is a serious mess right now. I have to order my stuff 
            to draw with the laptop.

        <p>As many of you probably know already, Team Fortress 2 is facing a massive bot problem,

            This hackers who make countless accounts letting a bot play the game, usually picking sniper
            with aimbot so they can insta-kill you, are making the game unplayable in official Valve servers...

        <p>Basically everything went perfectly, the surgery was a success and I'm recovering at home.
            <br>
            The best part is that I can be drawing all day long so I get enough practice for commissions
            (which will be probably open in june-july)...

            Everything has a logical explination and nowdays is just a story of the many others I have to tell.
            Of course we didn't get high for real, and I seriously <b>DO NOT</b> encourage anyone to do drugs...
